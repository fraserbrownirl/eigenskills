# SkillsSeal Registry

A curated registry of agent skills for the SkillsSeal platform.

## Structure

```
skills/
├── humanize-ai-text/     # Rewrite AI text to sound natural
├── translate-text/       # Translate text between languages (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
└── summarize-text/       # Extractive text summarization
```

Each skill is a folder containing:
- `SKILL.md` — frontmatter metadata + instructions
- `scripts/` — executable scripts the agent runs

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill must have a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: >
  What this skill does. EigenAI reads this to route tasks.
version: 1.0.0
author: github-username
requires_env:
  - API_KEY_NAME
execution:
  - run: python3 scripts/main.py {{input}}
dependencies:
  - python3
---
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique skill identifier (matches folder name) |
| `description` | What the skill does (used by EigenAI for routing) |
| `version` | Semantic version |
| `author` | GitHub username of the publisher |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `requires_env` | Env vars the skill needs (agent only passes these — sandboxed) |
| `execution` | Structured steps to run. If absent, EigenAI plans the steps. |
| `dependencies` | System/pip dependencies needed |

## Contributing

1. Create a folder under `skills/` with your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter
3. Add your scripts in `scripts/`
4. Open a PR — skills require maintainer review before merge

## Registry Index

`registry.json` is auto-generated by a GitHub Action on every merge to main. Do not edit it manually.
