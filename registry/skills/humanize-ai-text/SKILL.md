# Humanize AI Text

Detects AI-generated text patterns and rewrites content to sound more natural. Part of [[text-tools]] — runs locally without [[x402-payments]].

Use after [[ai]] skills to polish generated content. See also [[summarize-text]] and [[translate-text]] for other text processing.

## Usage

Provide text as input. The skill will:
1. Analyze the text for common AI-generated patterns (repetitive structure, hedging language, etc.)
2. Rewrite the text to sound more natural while preserving meaning

## Examples

Input: "It is important to note that the implementation of sustainable practices is crucial for the long-term viability of organizations."

Output: "Sustainable practices matter for any organization that wants to last."
