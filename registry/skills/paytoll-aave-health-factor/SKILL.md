# Aave Health Factor

Get position health and liquidation risk via [[x402-payments]]. The health factor is the ratio of collateral value to borrowed value — below 1.0 means liquidation.

Check this before and after [[paytoll-aave-borrow]] or [[paytoll-aave-withdraw]] operations. If health factor is low, use [[paytoll-aave-repay]] to improve it.

For a complete view of all positions, use [[paytoll-aave-user-positions]]. See [[aave-lending]] for risk management guidance.
