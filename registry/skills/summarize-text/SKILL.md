# Summarize Text

Summarizes long text into concise bullet points or a short paragraph. Part of [[text-tools]] — runs locally without [[x402-payments]].

## Usage

Provide text as input. The skill will extract the most important sentences
and return a condensed version.

## Examples

Input: A 500-word article about climate change.

Output: 3-5 key sentences capturing the main points.
