# Translate Text

Translates text between languages using the OpenAI API. Part of [[text-tools]] but requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

For pay-per-call translation without managing keys, consider [[ai]] skills. See also [[humanize-ai-text]] and [[summarize-text]].

## Usage

Provide text with a target language instruction, e.g.:
- "Translate to Spanish: Hello, how are you?"
- "Convert this to Japanese: The weather is nice today."

## Requirements

Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be configured.
